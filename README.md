# Image-Processing
An image processing (or photo editing) software like Photo Shop allows you to load an image (like the photographer image here) and apply some changes (called filters) to image and then save it again.

### You can choose to do any of the below filters to apply it on any image:
- Filter 1: Black and White Image

- Filter 2: Invert Image

- Filter 3: Merge Images

- Filter 4: Flip Image

- Filter 5: Rotate Image

- Filter 6: Darken and Lighten Image

- Filter 7: Detect Image Edges

- Filter 8: Enlarge Image

- Filter 9: Shrink Image

- Filter a: Mirror Image

- Filter b: Shuffle Image

- Filter c: Blur Image
